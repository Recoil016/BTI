# Topper's MiniBoss and LiveMap

This section of the repository houses two of the main web applications I made for DCS.
 * A `core` that takes care of:
  * Reading and exposing the greenie board information generated by the MOOSE Airboss
  * AAW: Read and expose which slots are still available. See CSARPersisted in BTI
  * TOP: Read and expose the file that contains which units are currently on the map. See TOPTracking in BTI
 * A React application under `live` that needs to be served from a webserver that will connect to the core and offer the user several features:
  * A live map with various layer filtering to show an accurate representation of what is currently tracked by the mission in DCS
  * A Greenie board that will present the data saved by the Airboss
